# Coding-Quiz
Coding quiz challenge

A coding quiz to test the basic knowledge of a user on coding terminology. The functionality is built in javascript, most of the functions have been completed and the page loads with no errors. The console log shows details of a correct answer and details of what should be happening on the screen. The questions have been stored as objects within an array. 

There are five questions in total, designed to make you think quickly, while some of the questions may require some thought! 

The timer countdown starts once you start the quiz, which gives you 90 seconds to complete. Once the timer runs out, the end quiz function runs in the console log.
